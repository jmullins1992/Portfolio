# Portfolio
A portfolio of various projects I've worked on

I worked on these projects while serving as an apprentice at the Software Guild in Akron, OH.
The Software Guild is a programming bootcamp that offers training experience in Java and C# .NET 
I attended the C# .NET cohort from April to early July of 2015

The Flooring Mastery project was a collaborative effort between myself and S. Gross
